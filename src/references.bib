                  risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease later in
                  adulthood, attributed to cardiovascular and metabolic
                  alterations in early life. However, there is paucity of
                  evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
                  METHODS: We investigated the differences between preterm (<37
                  weeks gestational age) and term-born individuals in birth
                  length and weight as well as adult (18 and 20 years) height,
                  weight and blood pressure in the Brazilian 1993 Pelotas birth
                  cohort using linear regressions. Analyses were adjusted for
                  the maternal weight at the beginning of pregnancy and maternal
                  education and family income at childbirth. Additional models
                  were adjusted for body mass index (BMI) and birthweight.
                  Separate analyses were run for males and females. The complete
                  sample was analysed with an interaction term for sex. RESULTS:
                  Of the 3585 babies included at birth, 3010 were followed up in
                  adulthood at 22 years. Preterm participants had lower length
                  and weight at birth. This difference remained for male
                  participants in adulthood, but female participants were no
                  shorter than their term counterparts by 18 years of age. At 22
                  years, females born preterm had lower blood pressures
                  (systolic blood pressure -1.00 mmHg, 95\%CI -2.7, 0.7 mmHg;
                  diastolic blood pressure -1.1 mmHg, 95\%CI -2.4, 0.3 mmHg)
                  than females born at term. These differences were not found in
                  male participants. CONCLUSIONS: In this Brazilian cohort we
                  found contrasting results regarding the association of preterm
                  birth with blood pressure in young adulthood, which may be
                  unique to an LMIC.},

  abstract     = {IntroductionThe burden of multimorbidity is recognised
                  increasingly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),
                  creating a strong emphasis on the need for effective
                  evidence-based interventions. Core outcome sets (COS)
                  appropriate for the study of multimorbidity in LMICs do not
                  presently exist. These are required to standardise reporting
                  and contribute to a consistent and cohesive evidence-base to
                  inform policy and practice. We describe the development of two
                  COS for intervention trials aimed at preventing and treating
                  multimorbidity in adults in LMICs.MethodsTo generate a
                  comprehensive list of relevant prevention and treatment
                  outcomes, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative
                  interviews with people with multimorbidity and their
                  caregivers living in LMICs. We then used a modified two-round
                  Delphi process to identify outcomes most important to four
                  stakeholder groups (people with multimorbidity/caregivers,
                  multimorbidity researchers, healthcare professionals and
                  policymakers) with representation from 33 countries. Consensus
                  meetings were used to reach agreement on the two final COS.
                  Registration:https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/1580.ResultsThe
                  systematic review and qualitative interviews identified 24
                  outcomes for prevention and 49 for treatment of
                  multimorbidity. An additional 12 prevention and 6 treatment
                  outcomes were added from Delphi round 1. Delphi round 2
                  surveys were completed by 95 of 132 round 1 participants
                  (72.0\%) for prevention and 95 of 133 (71.4\%) participants
                  for treatment outcomes. Consensus meetings agreed four
                  outcomes for the prevention COS: (1) adverse events, (2)
                  development of new comorbidity, (3) health risk behaviour and
                  (4) quality of life; and four for the treatment COS: (1)
                  adherence to treatment, (2) adverse events, (3) out-of-pocket
                  expenditure and (4) quality of life.ConclusionFollowing
                  established guidelines, we developed two COS for trials of
                  interventions for multimorbidity prevention and treatment,
                  specific to adults in LMIC contexts. We recommend their
                  inclusion in future trials to meaningfully advance the field
                  of multimorbidity research in LMICs.PROSPERO registration

                  counts, which overlooks nuanced relationships among
                  conditions. We identified clusters of multimorbidity and
                  subpopulations with varying risks and examined their
                  association with all-cause mortality using a data-driven
                  approach. We analysed 8-year follow-up data of people ≥35
                  years who were part of the CRONICAS Cohort Study, a multisite
                  cohort from Peru. First, we used Partitioning Around Medoids
                  and multidimensional scaling to identify multimorbidity
                  clusters. We then estimated the association between
                  multimorbidity clusters and all-cause mortality. Second, we
                  identified subpopulations using finite mixture modelling. Our
                  analysis revealed three clusters of chronic conditions:
                  respiratory (cluster 1: bronchitis, COPD and asthma),
                  lifestyle, hypertension, depression and diabetes (cluster 2),
                  and circulatory (cluster 3: heart disease, stroke and
                  peripheral artery disease). While only the cluster comprising
                  circulatory diseases showed a significant association with
                  all-cause mortality in the overall population, we identified
                  two latent subpopulations (named I and II) exhibiting
                  differential mortality risks associated with specific
                  multimorbidity clusters. These findings underscore the
                  importance of considering multimorbidity clusters and
                  sociodemographic characteristics in understanding mortality
                  risks. They also highlight the need for tailored interventions
                  to address the unique needs of different subpopulations living
                  with multimorbidity to reduce mortality risks effectively.},
