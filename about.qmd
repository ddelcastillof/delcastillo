I am a Peruvian physician-scientist, musician, and gamer. My research focus is to understand the link between early life exposures and the development of non-communicable diseases, particularly cardiometabolic outcomes.

Darwin is a Peruvian Medical Doctor with a Master of Public Health from the University of Washington. His research focuses on understanding how early life exposures affect long-term cardiometabolic outcomes by leveraging knowledge at the intersection of epidemiology, genetics, and data science. He has extensive experience in epidemiology and data analysis. In his free time, he enjoys playing guitar, doing outdoor activities, playing with his two cats, and exploring immersive narrative experiences through videogames. Darwin holds a M.D. from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, [the oldest university in the American continent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation#Latin_America_and_the_Caribbean).

During his medical training, Darwin witnessed diverse underserved populations devastated by non-communicable diseases—often multiple conditions simultaneously. Seeing how social disparities ravaged families through limited healthcare access and poor health outcomes ignited his passion to increase data representation of these marginalized communities. His experiences across Peru's diverse populations deepened his perspective and strengthened his commitment to addressing health inequities through rigorous research.
